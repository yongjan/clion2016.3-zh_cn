        The Pull Members Up refactoring allows you to move class members to a base class. The Push Members Down refactoring helps clean up the class hierarchy by moving class members to a subclass.</p>
    <p>CLion highlights dependant members so you never miss one while refactoring your code.</p>
    <p>
        To pull members up through the hierarchy press
            <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:MemberPullUp;</span> (<span class="control">Refactor | Pull Members Up...</span>).
        To push members down press
            <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:MemberPushDown;</span> (<span class="control">Refactor | Push Members Down...</span>).</p>
