        You can easily generate definitions for existing declarations by pressing
        <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:CIDR.Lang.Cpp.GenerateDefinitions;</span>
        (<span class="control">Code | Generate Definitions</span>).</p>

    <p>CLion is able to adapt to the patterns you are using in your project. It can detect and support three possible patterns:
        <ul>
        <li>declarations are located in header files, definitions are in cpp-files;</li>
        <li>class/struct is located in header file only; or</li>
        <li>class/struct is located in cpp-file only.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If you switch from one of these patterns to another (by using <em>Generate in-place</em> option), CLion will pick up on that and behave accordingly when you use code generation the next time.</p>
