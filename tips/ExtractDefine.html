        The Extract Define refactoring helps you simplify complicated statements in your code by defining the selected set of tokens as macro using <i>#define</i> directive and replacing the set of tokens with macro call in the code; macro definition can be located in the current file or moved to the related header file.</p>
    <p>
        For example, in the code fragment below, you could select an expression in the code</p>
    <p class="image">
        <img src="images/ExtractDefine/image1.png"></p>
    <p>
        and press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:CIDR.Lang.IntroduceDefine;</span>
        (<span class="control">Refactor | Extract Define</span>).</p>
    <p>
        This will result in the following:</p>
